Project: Public Health: National Nutritional Health

Introduction:

NHANES, initiated by the CDC, is a program designed to evaluate the health and nutritional status of both adults and children across the United States. The collected data helps identify disease prevalence and risk factors, establish national health standards, and support research in epidemiology and health sciences. This valuable information contributes to shaping public health policies, creating health programs and services, and enhancing the nation's understanding of health. An objective for your report could be.  

Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze the NHANES dataset by handling missing data, visualizing key health metrics (BMI, weight, weight in pounds, and age), and exploring statistical measures such as the mean pulse rate, diastolic blood pressure range, and income variance and investigate the relationship between weight and height, stratified by gender, diabetes status, and smoking habits, and to conduct t-tests to examine potential associations between variables like age and gender, BMI and diabetes.

Visualization the distribution of BMI, Weight, Weight in pounds:


Fig 1, Four histograms representing different distributions of a dataset.

Observations: 

BMI Distribution:

Most of the individuals have a BMI between 15 and 40, with a peak around 20–30, indicating that most people in the dataset have a BMI in the normal to overweight range.

Weight Distribution:

The highest concentration of individuals weighs between 50 to 100 kilograms, with fewer people weighing above or below this range.

Weight in Pounds Distribution:

Like the weight distribution in kilograms, most people weigh between 100 and 200 pounds, with some outliers.

Age Distribution: 

There is a relatively even spread of individuals from ages 20 to 80, though the number of individuals in each age group fluctuates slightly across the graph.

Each histogram gives insight into the distribution of a particular variable in the dataset, allowing for easy comparison of frequencies across ranges

Visualization of the relationship between weight and height 




Fig2 A scatter plot depicting the relationship between weight and height with data points colored according to gender as red dots represent females and blue dots represent males.



Observations:

There is a positive correlation between height and weight, meaning taller individuals tend to weigh more. The points are clustered in a curve that shows an increase in weight with increasing height. There are several individuals with very low height (close to zero), which might indicate a specific category of data, such as infants or individuals with specific conditions. This cluster appears in both male and female data.


Results: 

The mean 60-second pulse rate for all participants in the data is 73.63382, the range of values for diastolic blood pressure in all participants is 0-116, the variance of the income is 1264147754 and the Standard deviation of the income is 35554.86. The large variance and standard deviation values indicate that there is a wide range of incomes in the dataset, with some individuals earning amounts far from the average. T-test was conducted between Age and Gender since the p-value is greater than the common significance level (0.05), the result is not statistically significant, meaning that the difference in age between males and females might be due to random chance. In T test conducted between BMI and Diabetes. The p-value is extremely small meaning the observed difference in BMI between diabetic and non-diabetic groups is highly statistically significant. The likelihood of this difference occurring by chance is virtually nonexistent.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, based on the analysis of the provided data, the average 60-second pulse rate among participants was 73.63382, indicating a relatively normal heart rate, the diastolic blood pressure values ranged from 0 to 116, suggesting a wide variation in blood pressure levels among the participants. Furthermore, the large variance and standard deviation of income indicate a significant spread of income values in the dataset, with some individuals earning substantially more or less than the average. T-test highlights a diverse range of health metrics among the participants and shows a direct relationship between the BMI and diabetes, indicating a potential risk factor for the disease. Also, t-test revealed no significant difference in age between males and females, suggesting that observed differences might be due to chance.
