**SUMMARY**

**Gene-Level Differential Expression**

The study analyzed gene expression across 12 cancer types, revealing variable overlap of differentially expressed (DE) genes. For instance, lung cancers (LUAD and LUSC) shared 55% of their DE genes, while kidney cancers (KICH and KIRC) had less than 10% overlap.

**Gene Clustering and Gene Set Association Analysis**

Through gene set association analysis, 46 significant gene sets were identified across all cancer types. Seven cross-cancer gene signatures were consistently altered in multiple malignancies:

- **CLUSTER241**: Found in BLCA, BRCA, COAD, HNSC, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC. Enriched in cell cycle and aneuploidy pathways. Key genes include Kinesins, MKI67, TOP2A, ERBB2/HER2.

- **CLUSTER514**: Present in BLCA, BRCA, COAD, HNSC, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC. Related to cell cycle processes and cancer. Key genes include EZH2, AURKA, BIRC5, TK1, PLK1.

- **CLUSTER1011**: Found in BLCA, BRCA, COAD, HNSC, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC. Associated with Fanconi anemia and cell cycle checkpoints. Key genes include BRIP1, KIAA1524/CIP2A, CENPH.

- **CLUSTER932**: Present in BLCA, BRCA, COAD, HNSC, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC. Related to retinoblastoma and cell cycle mitosis. Key genes include CCNE1, CCNE2, CDC6, E2F7, UHRF1.

- **CLUSTER574**: Altered in BRCA, COAD, HNSC, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC. Associated with mitotic cell cycle and pancreatic diseases. Key genes include FOXM1, TYMS, RRM2, SKA1.

- **CLUSTER3137**: Found in BLCA, COAD, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC. Linked with retinoblastoma and cell cycle processes. Key genes include SKP2, RRM1, DNMT1.

- **CLUSTER184**: Present in BLCA, BRCA, LUAD, LUSC. Associated with aneuploidy and cell cycle regulation. Key genes include AURKB, UBE2C/UBCH10.

**Gene Signatures Specific to Individual Cancers**

- **Lung cancer:** CLUSTER1520 (SFTPA1, SFTPA2), CLUSTER901 (GPRC5A, WNT7A, CLDN18, ADRB2), CLUSTER1057 (IL33, IFNAR2, GIMAP6, GIMAP8).

- **Bladder cancer (BLCA):** CLUSTER2174 (FGFR1), CLUSTER1860 (GJC1/CX45, SPARCL1).

- **Breast cancer (BRCA):** CLUSTER891 (p53, FDXR, SDC1).

- **Kidney Cancer (KICH):** CLUSTER2240 (NPHP1/NPH1).

**Validation and Cross-Validation**

A 14-gene signature was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) across cancer types, showing high classification accuracy (BLCA: 92.04%, BRCA: 96.23%, COAD: 91.76%, HNSC: 90.05%, LIHC: 88.17%, LUAD: 94.29%, LUSC: 99.10%). Validation on external datasets (GSE40419, GSE50760) confirmed the signature’s effectiveness (97.14% and 93.33%).

**Conclusion**

The study clustered genes into co-regulated sets, revealing common and cancer-specific gene signatures. These findings enhance understanding of cancer etiology and hold significant potential for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
