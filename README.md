**Bioinformatics Internship**

**Overview**

All of the work and projects done during the HackBio Bioinformatics Internship program are included in this repository. Technical writing, literature reviews, coding, data analysis, and pipeline construction are just a few of the practical bioinformatics skills that the internship aims to impart. The internship progresses from one phase to the next, ending in a final project that incorporates all of the skills learnt.

**Stages:**

**Stage 0: Technical Writing**

Fundamental technical writing abilities, concentrating on communicating intricate scientific ideas in an understandable and succinct manner. 

**Stage 1: Comparative Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes Across Cancers**

Gene expression profiles across 12 distinct cancer types, uncovering varying degrees of overlap among differentially expressed genes.

**Stage 2: Coding and Visualization**

Using coding knowledge to evaluate biological data and produce insightful visualisations.

**Stage 3: Pipeline Implementation for a Basic Problem Set**

Constructing and putting into use a bioinformatics pipeline to address a specific set of issues.

**Stage 4: Pipeline Implementation II**

Reproducing the findings of a bioinformatics article that has been published.

**Stages 5-7: Final Project**

A comprehensive project that integrates all the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the internship.

Each Stage of the internship is organized into its own folder, which includes all associated materials such as essays, code, and images. 

**README Files:** Every stage folder contains a `README.md` file that outlines key details and provides stage-specific instructions.  

**Code and Data:** Any code or datasets utilized during a specific stage are stored within the corresponding folder, if applicable.
