**Bioinformatics Internship**
Overview
This repository contains all the work and projects completed as part of the HackBio Bioinformatics Internship program. The internship is designed to provide hands-on experience in bioinformatics, including technical writing, literature review, coding, data analysis, and pipeline implementation. Each stage of the internship builds on the previous one, culminating in a final project that integrates all the skills acquired.

Stages
Stage 0: Technical Writing
In this stage, I developed essential technical writing skills, focusing on clear and concise communication of complex scientific concepts. The tasks involved writing a short essay on a key concept in Data Science and Machine Learning as it relates to cancer research.

Subsequent Stages
The repository will be updated with subsequent stages of the internship as they are completed. Below is a brief overview of what to expect:

Stage 2: Coding and Visualization

Application of coding skills to analyze biological data and create meaningful visualizations.
Stage 3: Pipeline Implementation for a Basic Problem Set

Building and implementing a bioinformatics pipeline to solve a predefined problem set.
Stage 4: Pipeline Implementation II

Reproducing the results of a published bioinformatics paper.
Stages 5-7: Final Project

A comprehensive project that integrates all the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the internship.
How to Navigate This Repository
Stages: Each stage of the internship has its own directory containing all relevant files, including essays, code, and images.
README Files: Each stage directory contains a README.md that provides an overview and instructions specific to that stage.
Code and Data: If applicable, code and datasets used in the stages will be stored in their respective directories.
